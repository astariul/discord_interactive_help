A Discord python framework to display an interactive help easily.

## Features

* ðŸ”† **Easy to naviguate** : Use reactions to naviguate through the Help manual.
* âš™ **Customized reaction** : Use any emoji as naviguation icon.
* ðŸŽ® **Commands support** : Go even further with interactive commands.

## How to use

Download the files `help.py` and `page.py` into your bot's code, and create your own help manual :

```
# Define each page
root = page.Page('Welcome !\n')
page_1 = page.Page('This is page 1', parent=root)
page_2 = page.Page('This is page 2', parent=page_1, root=root)

# Link pages together
page_1.add_link(page_2, 'Click this icon to access page 2', 'ðŸ’©')
root.add_link(page_1, 'Click this icon to access page 1')

# Create the Help object
client = discord.Client()
h = Help(client, root)

# And display the help !
await h.display(message.author)
```

## Notes

* *This idea was already known for some time, I didn't get the idea myself. I just wanted to share an easy framework to implement it for your own bot.*

* *This is working only with the Python Discord API.*
