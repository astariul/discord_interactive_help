A Discord python framework to display an interactive help easily.

## Features

* ðŸ”† **Easy to naviguate** : Use reactions to naviguate through the Help manual.
* âš™ **Customized reaction** : Use any emoji as naviguation icon.
* ðŸŽ® **Commands support** : Go even further with interactive commands.

## How to use

Download the package :

`pip install discord-interactive`

---

Import the `Page` and `Help` objects into your bot's code, and create your own help manual :

```py
from discord_interactive import Page, Help

# Define each page
root = Page('Welcome !\n')
page_1 = Page('This is page 1')
page_2 = Page('This is page 2')

# Link pages together
page_1.link(page_2, description='Click this icon to access page 2', reaction='ðŸ’©')
root.link(page_1, description='Click this icon to access page 1')

# Set the root page as the root of other page (so user can come back with a specific reaction)
root.root_of([page_1, page_2])

# Create the Help object
client = discord.Client()
h = Help(client, root)

...

# And display the help !
await h.display(message.author)
```

## Notes

* *This idea was already known for some time, I didn't get the idea myself. I just wanted to share an easy framework to implement it for your own bot.*

* *This is working only with the Python Discord API.*

## History

* **v4**
    * Added `Embed` support. Refer to the [official Discord documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#embed) for more information.
    * Message are now displayed as `Embed` by default. You can still create raw-message pages with the `embed=False` argument.

* **v3**
    * Refactor API

* **v2.1**
    * Added support for the new version of `Discord py`. Just download the last version of the package (`pip install -U discord-interactive`).
    * If you still use the old version of `Discord py`, then keep using the version `1.1` of this package (`pip install 'discord-interactive==1.1' --force-reinstall`)
